Spring boot autoconfiguration can be done with two main things
@SpringBootApplication	 
					-	@SpringBootConfiguration
							this reads all the configurations in the application and does configurations based on that.
					-	@EnableAutoConfiguration
							@AutoConfigurationPackage- this autoconfigures based on our application pom and other things, we have an option to exclude few auto configurations.
SpringApplication.run	
					- 	after all project and auto configurations, bootstrap the app then creates the application context ie.ConfigurableApplicationContext and check for listeners and start the application.
